# Frontend Development Principles

## Core Principles

### 1. User-Centric Design

All frontend development must prioritize user experience:

- Design for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance)
- Optimize for performance (Core Web Vitals)
- Ensure responsive design across all devices
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions

### 2. Component-Based Architecture

Use a component-based approach with React/NextJS:

- Create reusable, composable components
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper prop validation
